### instagram-flickr

------

#### Synopsis

This is part 1 of the series - "Let's build that page", and here is my take on designing instagram with flickr api integration.

#### Technology Stack

User interface is done using html and css (obviously), but also take advantage of [fontawesome](http://fontawesome.io) javascript library to take advantage of the awsome font offerings. Most of the logic is done in vanilla javascript, but also depend on Ajax api's offered by [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).
