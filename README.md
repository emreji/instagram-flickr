#### Synopsis

This is part 1 of the series - "Let's build that page", and here is my take on designing instagram with flickr api integration.

#### Technology Stack

User interface is done using html and css (obviously), but also took advantage of [fontawesome](http://fontawesome.io) javascript library to use the awesome font offerings. Most of the logic is done in vanilla javascript, but also is dependent on Ajax api's offered by [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

#### Architecture

This project uses N-Tier architecture to integrate with Flickr API. The following diagram represents the architecture:
